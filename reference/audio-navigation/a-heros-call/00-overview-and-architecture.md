## 1. What the game actually is (mechanically)

A Hero's Call is a **grid-based first-person dungeon RPG** played entirely by ear. The player
occupies a continuous 2D position on a tile grid and faces a continuous compass heading. There is
**no third dimension for navigation** — "first person" here means a 2D top-down world presented from
the player's heading. All spatial information reaches the player through three channels:

1. **The reactive radar** — short looping cues that tell you, *as you move*, whether walls are
   closing in or opening up to your front/left/right, plus a rising pitch when a wall is within 3
   tiles ahead. (Doc 02.)
2. **Positional audio** — every object, terrain tile, and ambient emitter is a 3D FMOD sound, panned
   and attenuated relative to the player's position and heading, and **muffled/muted through walls
   and doors**. (Doc 08.)
3. **Screen-reader / TTS speech** — discrete announcements: region names on crossing boundaries,
   the result of a directional "scan", examine/interact text, beacon distance+direction. (Docs 05–09.)

The genius of the design — and the reason it ports so well — is that **the world model is trivially
simple (a tile grid with per-tile flags) and every cue is derived by raycasting that grid**. If you
can produce, in your target game, (a) the player's position+heading and (b) a way to ask "what is at
world point P / along ray R", you can reproduce the entire system.

## 2. The five assemblies that matter

| Assembly | Namespace | Role for navigation |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| `Core` | `Ian` | `V2`, `V3`, `Line` math; `MyMath`, `VectorHelpers`, `VectorExtensions`; `DiagSO` base |
| `Sound` | `Ian` | `ReactiveRadar`, `CollisionHelperCopy` (raycaster), `ObstructionHelpers`, `MapSoundHandler` (per-frame audio driver), the `I2D/I3DSoundSource` + `IAudible*` interfaces |
| `FirstPerson` | `Ian` | `FPExploring` (the gameplay state / input loop), `FPMapLogic` (movement+collision), `POIHelpers` (scan), `DirectionHelper` (compass binning), `FPBeaconMenu`, `FPMapOverview` |
| `GameEngine` | `Ian` | `SpeechContext` (TTS/Tolk), `GameConfig` (tunables) |
| `Translate` | `Ian` | `TranslateSO` / `TranslateAPI` — localized speech strings (`TSay`) |

## 3. The coordinate system (read this before anything else)

This single section prevents 90% of porting bugs.

- Positions are `V2` (`float X, float Y`). The world is a tile grid; **tile (i,j) spans `[i, i+1) × [j, j+1)`** and its **center is `(i+0.5, j+0.5)`**. Integer player tile = `(floor(X), floor(Y))`.
- **`+X` is East, `+Y` is South.** Y increases *downward* (screen/tile convention), not upward. This is why the cardinal vectors are `North=(0,-1)`, `South=(0,1)`, `East=(1,0)`, `West=(-1,0)` (see `FPExploring`).
- **Heading is a compass angle in degrees, clockwise, 0° = North.** `0=N, 90=E, 180=S, 270=W`.
- Heading → unit vector (the authoritative conversion, `MyMath.GetUnitVectorFromCompassDegrees`):

  ```csharp
  // degrees: compass, 0=N, clockwise. Returns a unit V2 in (+X=East, +Y=South) space.
  float r = degrees * PI/180;
  V2 front = new V2( sin(r), -cos(r) ).Normalized();
  //   0° -> ( 0, -1) North      90° -> ( 1, 0) East
  // 180° -> ( 0,  1) South     270° -> (-1, 0) West
  ```

- The perpendiculars (from `V2`): `PerpendicularRight = (Y, -X)`, `PerpendicularLeft = (-Y, X)`.
  In this Y-down frame, **`Left = Front.PerpendicularRight`** and **`Right = Front.PerpendicularLeft`**
  (see `MapAndPlayer`). Do not "fix" this to look right-handed; it is internally consistent with Y-down.

Full detail and the inverse (vector → compass angle) are in Doc 01.

## 4. The per-frame data flow

Everything spatial is driven once per frame from **`MapSoundHandler.UpdateMapSoundss(...)`**
(`Sound/Ian/MapSoundHandler.cs:208`). The gameplay state `FPExploring.Process()` updates the player
position/heading and calls into this. The essential pipeline:

```
FPExploring.Process()                       // FirstPerson: input, movement, region check, scans
  └─ player Position (V2), Facing (deg), Velocity (V2) updated
MapSoundHandler.UpdateMapSoundss(map, actors, playerPos, facingDeg, velocity, inMenu)
  ├─ build MapAndPlayer 'ent'               // bundles pos, Front/Left/Right…, map, velocity, inMenu
  ├─ set FMOD 3D listener (pos + forward + up)
  ├─ mRadar.RunRadar(ent)                   // <-- the reactive radar (Doc 02)
  ├─ for each positioned/terrain/object sound:
  │     ObstructionHelpers.PositionSoundForObstruction(ent, srcPos, sound, …)
  │       └─ depth = CollisionHelperCopy.GetWallAndDoorDepth(map, listener, src)   // raycast (Doc 03)
  │       └─ mute if depth>=1 ; set obstruction/indoor status ; sound.Update(srcPos)
  └─ zone change? -> swap FMOD reverb snapshot (Doc 06)
```

Independently, **`FPExploring`** handles the discrete/speech side each frame:
`HandleRegion()` (enter/leave announcements), `RunForwardComparison()` (auto forward POI scan),
side-radar comparisons, beacons, and key handling for manual scans / examine / interact.

## 6. Porting strategy in one paragraph

Build an **engine adapter** exposing exactly: `PlayerPosition (Vector2 in tile units)`,
`HeadingDegrees (compass)`, and `Tile QueryTile(int x,int y)` / `RaycastFirstBlocking(origin, dir, maxDist)`.
Behind that adapter, copy the `Ian` math (`V2`, compass conversions), the raycaster
(`CollisionHelperCopy`), and the radar (`ReactiveRadar`) almost verbatim — they have **no engine
dependencies** beyond the adapter and a "play this short sound with this stereo pan" primitive. For
games that are not tile-based (SF6, RE7, XV2 are continuous 3D), you replace `QueryTile` with a
physics raycast and quantize positions to a virtual grid only where the algorithm needs integers
(the pitch-distance rounding). The full mapping is in Doc 10.
