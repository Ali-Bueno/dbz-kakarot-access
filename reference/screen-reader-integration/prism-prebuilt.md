# PRISM — consuming the prebuilt release (verified, DO NOT re-investigate)

> **Read this when:** you're wiring PRISM into a mod for the first time (any engine) and need the
> concrete facts about the release layout, exports, call sequence and what to ship. One-time-per-mod
> reference — not needed once the adapter is working. For *how the call physically reaches PRISM on
> each engine* (the transport), see [the integration index](README.md).
>
> Checked against **PRISM v0.16.7** by downloading the asset and reading the binary/headers.
> **No need to compile the PRISM repo or use CMake/vcpkg** to consume it: the release is enough.

- **Per-platform releases** on GitHub (`ethindp/prism`, assets of the latest release). For Windows:
  **`prism-windows-x64.zip`** and `prism-windows-arm64.zip`. **There is no x86 (32-bit) build** → if the
  game/host is 32-bit, the PRISM prebuilt is NOT usable (you'd have to compile). Most modern x64 games →
  use `x64`.
- **Stable C API**: `include/prism.h` is wrapped in `extern "C"`, pure C types (`char*`, `float`,
  `size_t`, opaque pointers `PrismContext*`/`PrismBackend*`), `__cdecl` convention, `PRISM_API` macro
  (`__declspec(dllimport/dllexport)`). **No C++ type crosses the boundary** → a DLL built with **MinGW or
  MSVC** can consume `prism.dll` (which is built with MSVC) **with no ABI problems**.
- On **x64 the exports are NOT decorated** (`prism_init`, `prism_backend_speak`, …) → the most robust
  path is **dynamic loading**: `LoadLibrary("prism.dll")` + `GetProcAddress` by name. Zero link config,
  zero import lib, and you control when it loads (key if it's an injected DLL: load outside `DllMain`).
- **Windows zip contents**: `include/prism.h`; `dynamic/release/bin/prism.dll` (~1.1 MB, **the one you
  distribute**) + `tolk.dll` (~525 KB, NVDA/JAWS fallback backend); `dynamic/release/lib/prism.lib`
  (MSVC import lib, optional); a CMake package (target **`prism::prism`**). It also includes `static/`
  with a ~79 MB `prism.lib` → **it's MSVC C++: NOT linkable from MinGW** (MSVC only, yields a single
  self-contained DLL).
- **`prism.dll` runtime dependencies**: only system DLLs + UCRT (`KERNEL32`, `USER32`, `ole32`,
  `OLEAUT32`, `RPCRT4`, `UIAutomationCore`, `api-ms-win-core-*`). **Does NOT depend on
  `vcruntime140`/`msvcp140`** → **no VC++ Redistributable required**. Asian-reader backends
  (`PCTKUSR.dll`, `ZDSRAPI_x64.dll`, Orca/SpeechDispatcher bridges) load **on demand**; for NVDA/JAWS/SAPI
  **you don't have to distribute them**.
- **Minimal sequence**: `prism_config_init` → `prism_init(&cfg)` → `prism_registry_acquire_best(ctx)` →
  `prism_backend_initialize(be)` → `prism_backend_speak(be, txt, interrupt)` → … → `prism_backend_free` +
  `prism_shutdown`. Use `interrupt=true` when switching context; log the chosen backend with
  `prism_registry_name`. Others: `prism_backend_braille`, `prism_backend_is_speaking`, `set_rate/volume/pitch`.
- **Static linking (source-level ports only)**: injected/plugin hosts dynamic-load `prism.dll`, but a mod
  compiled *into* the game (decomp / libultraship PC ports) can link `prism.lib` and call the API directly.
  The static `prism.lib` is **MSVC C++** → MSVC toolchain only (not MinGW). Still copy `prism.dll` (+
  `tolk.dll`) next to the exe as a POST_BUILD step.
- **Version note — use PRISM ≥ v0.17.0.** Releases v0.16.2–v0.16.7 had a regression
  ([issue #49](https://github.com/ethindp/prism/issues/49)) where the **NVDA backend's `initialize()`
  falsely succeeded when NVDA wasn't running, shadowing JAWS/other readers** — so `acquire_best` could
  pick a dead backend. **Fixed in v0.17.0** (2026-07-07); `acquire_best` is correct there. Only if you're
  pinned to an affected version, the workaround is to enumerate the registry and pick the highest-priority
  backend reporting `IS_SUPPORTED_AT_RUNTIME` instead of `acquire_best` — and retire that workaround once
  you upgrade to ≥ v0.17.0.
- **Deploy**: copy `prism.dll` (+ `tolk.dll`) next to the mod DLL. That's all.
