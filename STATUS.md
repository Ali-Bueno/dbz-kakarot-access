# STATUS — Dragon Ball Z Kakarot

> Per-mod status ledger / dashboard. Open this first when resuming the mod so progress isn't re-derived from the code each session. Keep it short — a dashboard, not docs. Update the **Next step** line and the section table whenever you finish a chunk. Derive every value from the game's real data — no guessed offsets.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-11

## Identity
- **Engine / framework:** UE4 (AT project) + UE4SS v3.0.1 — Lua scripts plus C bridge modules (`prism_bridge`, `audio_bridge`, `input_bridge`, `mem_bridge`).
- **Screen-reader transport:** PRISM (`prism.dll` + `prism_bridge.dll` in `Scripts/`, `tolk.dll` fallback backend).
- **Build command:** per-bridge `src/<bridge>/build.ps1` (rebuild only the bridge you touched). Lua is not compiled; validate syntax with `libs/lua54/luac.exe -p <file>`.
- **Game install path:** `D:\games\steam\steamapps\common\DRAGON BALL Z KAKAROT`. Exe + UE4SS at `…\AT\Binaries\Win64\`. RE dumps live there: **`CXXHeaderDump\`** (per-class `.hpp`, the authority on layouts/members — `AT.hpp` is the big one) and **`UE4SS_ObjectDump.txt`** (what Lua can actually reflect). Grep these instead of re-deriving.
- **Mod install path:** junction `…\DRAGON BALL Z KAKAROT\AT\Binaries\Win64\Mods\KakarotAccess\Scripts` → repo `mod/KakarotAccess/Scripts`; enabled in `mods.txt` (`KakarotAccess : 1`).
- **Run / test:** launch the game with the mod enabled. `Ctrl+Shift+R` in-game reloads the Lua feature adapters + i18n; `main.lua` changes (keybinds, `Mem.init`, `Speech.init`) or a new/rebuilt DLL need a full game restart.

## Section status
`done` = works with the screen reader on; `wip` = started; `todo` = not begun.

| Section / feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Speech pipeline (PRISM) | done | Logs chosen backend on boot |
| Overworld main menu (native selection) | done | `screen_field.lua`, reads via `UAT_UIStartTop` offsets |
| Battle-pause menu (native selection) | done | `screen_pause.lua`, `UAT_UIXCmnPause +0x43C` |
| Dialog / message / confirm popups | done | `screen_dialog.lua` (incl. reward/emblem content pools, gift picker) |
| NPC subtitles / dialogue | done | `screen_dialogue.lua` |
| Difficulty / choice lists | done | `screen_choicelist.lua`, `screen_choice.lua` |
| Options / System / Title / Tutorials / Tips | done | `screen_options/title/tutorials/tutorial/tips.lua` |
| Shops (food/material/info) + item palette | done | `screen_shop*.lua`, `screen_palette.lua` (verified in-game) |
| Items inventory + Party + Characters | done | Party/Characters done. Items list reads populated categories (via `Txt_Title00` detail-pane live name; reflected index tracks). EMPTY categories: the whole item UI goes STALE (row/detail/visible-count keep the last item), so emptiness is read from the native flag `itemMenu.hasItems = 0x620` (F4-confirmed; 0 = empty) and announced ("vacío") via `screen_list.lua` factory `empty_off` param. Verified in-game 2026-07-11 |
| Item submenu (use-item char select) | done | `screen_itemuse.lua` — A on a usable item → pick who uses it. Reads the on-screen `AT_UIItemMenu.WL_Start_Party_Bars` bar (the selected char; only it animates in): `Txt_Name01` + `Txt_Lv01→Txt_Lv02` level-up preview, with the "choose character" prompt. Registered before the item list reader. Verified in-game 2026-07-11 |
| Save / Load data slots | done | `screen_saveload.lua` — `AT_UIStartSaveLoad`. VIRTUALIZED 3-bar window (`UISaveLoadBar_List`), so pool-position ≠ ordinal. Ordinal from native index `saveLoad.selectedIndex = 0x410` (+1), cursor bar = `windowPos = 0x418` (F4-confirmed over ~11 saves); reads FILLED and EMPTY slots (Canvas_None checked first); SETTLE_TICKS debounce drops mid-scroll frames. Slow re-entry (widget destroyed+recreated → stale class-list cache) FIXED by `ui_core.first_on_screen` churn-force (re-scan a recently-on-screen class immediately, budget-gated). Verified in-game 2026-07-11 (reads all slots, correct index, fast entry, no lag). DEBUG off |
| Skill Palette / Super Attack equip | done | `screen_skillcustom.lua` — selected slot plate = `SelectActiveBorder` visible AND `BaseBlinkImage` hidden (structural plates 4/7 have both always ON); slot button from plate `ButtonIconImage` → `A.platbtn_name`; empty slot = literal "---" → "ranura vacía"; level/Ki/desc from the detail pane only while it names the same skill (pane lags and goes stale on empty). `SkillListMenu:GetSelectValue()` is DEAD here (frozen 0) — never use it. Verified in-game 2026-07-13 |
| Skill Tree / learn super attacks | done | `screen_skilltree.lua` — `Start_Skilltree_C` < `UAT_UISkillTreeMenu`, ALL reflected (`Txt_Skillname/Txt_Lv_Num/Txt_Energy_Num/Txt_Detail/Txt_Name`); orbs = `WL_Skilltree_Zorb00` TArray of 12 `UAT_UISkilltreeZorb`: entries 1–6 = REQUIRED cost, 7–12 = OWNED. Orb color = POSITION in its 6-orb grid (red/blue/green/purple/silver/gold — verified twice 2026-07-14; textures don't encode color, all named "Ins_Item"). Reads name+lvl+Ki+non-zero cost, desc, owned orbs at the end. "How to acquire" text is NOT on screen while browsing (7-node full-text scan) — it only exists in the post-A message window, which already reads (decision: leave as-is). LOCKED nodes: the ONLY marker the game exposes is the tree cursor's padlock (`UISkillTree.Skilltree_Cursor.WL_ImgIconMicon` visible), and only on a skill's ENTRY (lv-1) node when the skill is unowned — 6 capture rounds proved there is nothing else: no readable panel index/pointer/position (cursor grid coords do live at tree+0x15F8/+0x15FC as grid×95), key-help bar identical on every node, no cover/lock widget on screen; the char-level gate ("need level 10") exists ONLY in the post-confirm message window (dialog reader speaks it). So the lock is PROPAGATED by skill name within a screen visit (`locked_skills`, cleared in reset): once the entry node reads locked, every level of that skill announces "bloqueada". KNOWN LIMIT (accepted): reaching a level-2/3 node WITHOUT passing its level-1 node first announces no lock — unfixable by reflection. Round-7 panel sweep closed the last door: all 108 `WL_Ins_Panel_Cover` are visible always (a frame, not a padlock) and every skill icon is an anonymous `MaterialInstanceDynamic`, so panels can't be matched to skills. The real data (`USkillManager`/`USkillTree`) exposes ZERO reflected functions and owned levels live in private save memory (`USkillSave`) — a full fix needs native RE (Ghidra), deferred.

| Quest objective HUD (text) | wip | `quest_objective.lua` — `Quest_Navi_C` rows `Txt_List_00`; announces on change + F10 on demand. F10 needs a game RESTART (main.lua); reactive works on Ctrl+Shift+R. Pending verify |
| Cooking menu | wip | `screen_cooking.lua` revised; pending re-verify (detail-pane read, markup strip) |
| Fishing minigame | done | `screen_fishing.lua`; verified end-to-end (user landed a fish) |
| Soul Emblems grid / Community | done | `screen_community.lua`; verified in-game |
| Community Board cursor (story tutorial) | done | Verified in-game 2026-07-04, unblocked story; offsets in `native_offsets.commuBoard` |
| Story / battle results | done | `screen_results.lua`, `screen_battleresult.lua` (rank from brush textures) |
| Quest navigation radar | done | `nav_tracker.lua` + `audio_bridge`; auto-tracks quest markers, arrival cue confirmed |
| Radar categories 2.0 (sites/enemies/collectibles) | wip | Built 2026-07-06; pending in-game verify of the batch |
| R2 radar target picker (modal) | wip | Built 2026-07-04; needs a game RESTART to verify (new `input_bridge.dll`) |
| Battle monitor | wip | `battle_monitor.lua` present |

## Next step
**NEXT SESSION = GHIDRA: recover the per-skill OWNED LEVEL (skill-tree lock, the one open gap).**
Goal: given the hovered node (skill display name + level from the reflected detail pane), know whether
that node is acquired / learnable / locked — without needing to browse through the level-1 node first
(today's propagation limit, see the Skill Tree row).

Ready-made context (do NOT re-derive):
- Reflection is EXHAUSTED (7 in-game capture rounds, 2026-07-14). `USkillManager` (UActorComponent) and
  `USkillTree` expose ZERO reflected functions; the tree cursor's padlock is the only lock signal and it
  only marks a skill's entry node; panels are not identifiable (covers always on, icons are anonymous
  MIDs); no readable panel index/pointer/position exists.
- The DATA, from the CXX dump: `USkillManager` (size 0x140) holds `SkillDataTable` 0x100,
  `SkillTreeDataTable` 0x108, `SkillPaletteDataTable` 0x110, `SkillTree` 0x130, **`USkillSave* SkillSave`
  0x138**. `struct FSkillSaveInfo` has `TArray<FName> OpenSkillTreeId` (+0xF0) and
  **`TArray<FName> HaveSkillTreeId` (+0x100)** = the ACQUIRED node ids. `struct FSkillTreeDataTable`
  (a DataTable row) = `CHARACTER_TYPE Character` 0x18, `FName Skill` 0x20, `int32 SkillLevel` 0x28,
  `FName OpenSkillTree1/2/3`, **`int32 CharacterLevel` 0x58** (the "need level 10" gate), `int32 cost` 0x70.
- Plan: unpack the exe with Steamless first (SteamStub — see [[dbz-kakarot-decompilation-setup]]), then in
  Ghidra find where `USkillSave` stores per-character `FSkillSaveInfo` (offset inside the 0x19750 blob) and
  how a skill id maps to its tree rows. Read it at runtime through `mem_bridge` (the hybrid pattern already
  used for saveload/items native flags). The BLOCKER to solve is the mapping **localized display name →
  skill FName id** (the reader only has the display name): candidates = the SkillDataTable rows (reflected
  UDataTable: row name = FName id, and a row field likely holds the localization key), or reading the
  hovered node's id straight from the tree widget's private memory (cursor grid coords are at
  `tree+0x15F8/+0x15FC`, grid×95 — a per-node record may sit near them).
- Once the owned level is readable: announce "bloqueada" / "requiere nivel N" on EVERY node regardless of
  the browsing path, and drop the `locked_skills` name-propagation heuristic in `screen_skilltree.lua`.

## Backlog
All work through 2026-07-14 is COMMITTED and PUSHED (latest: 47df2d2). The narrative of how each
feature was derived lives in PROGRESS.md and in the git log; this list is only what is still OPEN.

- **Quest objective HUD** (`quest_objective.lua`) — pending verify. The F10 on-demand read needs a FULL
  game restart (Ctrl+Shift+R does not re-run main.lua, where the keybind is registered); no Lua errors in
  the log and the bind is present, so most likely it was just never restarted. The reactive reader only
  speaks when the objective CHANGES — an objective already on screen staying put is expected silence.
- **Radar 2.0 batch** — sites/enemies/collectibles categories + the "Caza"/Hunt category: built, never
  verified in-game. R2 target picker: check the boot log for `hooked=true`.
- **Cooking menu** (`screen_cooking.lua`) — revised, pending re-verify (detail-pane read, markup strip).
- **"View Controls"** (from the battle pause) reads jumbled, and the pause does not re-announce on return.
- Niceties: skill-palette plates 4/7 (structural, cursor never lands there so far); in assign mode the
  A/B press itself is silent until the first cursor move (no signal exists for the press).

## Known issues / open questions
- INTERMITTENT boot crash (2026-07-14, AV 0x10 right after "Event loop start", during the first map
  load): the event feed's drain probed widgets whose classes the async loader was still linking.
  HARDENED (committed): the drain skips + wipes while `Transition.active()`, every stashed widget waits
  one tick (`aged` queue) before any probe, PROBE_CAP=256/tick, STORM=2048 drop. **If a boot crash
  recurs → revert the notify feed to polling (plan B), stability over latency.**
- F7 discover dump can fatal (0xe06d7363) if the swept UI is dying mid-animation: two caught `brush_of`
  "nullptr instance" errors then a raw C++ throw (2026-07-14). Mitigated with a 3-failure fuse in
  `discover.lua brush_of`; still, avoid F7 during screen transitions/animations.
- R2 picker: if the boot log shows `hooked=false`, pad blocking is off (read-only) — needs a
  GetProcAddress/inline-hook fallback.
- After any game patch, re-verify offsets in `native_offsets.lua` via the F4 probe.
